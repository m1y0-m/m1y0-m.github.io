		<h2>Nowadays, first thing I see is the <a href = "https://artandarchaeology.princeton.edu/whats/resources/department/art-museum"> Art Museum </a>. </h2>
			<p> It's right in front of the back entrance of Dod hall, so it's the first thing I see when I leave my dorm every day. This thing was under construction forever, it was quite annoying. </p>
		<h3> Onwards </h3>
