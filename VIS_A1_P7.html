		<p> Two times a week, I get to eat at a dining hall (since I'm Independent). <p>
		<p> I usually eat at <a href = "https://dining.princeton.edu/locations-hours/whitman-college"> Whitman Dining Hall </a>. </p>
		<p> <a href = "VIS_A1_P5.html"> Go study at Lewis. Go straight out East exit. </a> </p>
		<p> <a href = "VIS_A1_P3.html"> Go hang out at Equad. Go straight out East exit, go left at Washington Road, turn right at William Street and go straight down. </a> </p>
