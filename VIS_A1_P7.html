		<h1> Food Time </h1>
			<p> Two times a week, I get to eat at a dining hall (since I'm Independent). <p>
		<h2> I usually eat at <a href = "https://artandarchaeology.princeton.edu/whats/resources/department/art-museum"> Whitman Dining Hall </a>. </h2>
			<p> Again, getting there from Equad, quite a pain. Kind of straight and to the left, largely. </p>
