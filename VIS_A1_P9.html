		<h2> Pass by <a href = "https://frist.princeton.edu/directions-and-location"> Coffee Club </a>. </h2>
			<p> Going straight from Frist, immediatley pass Coffee Club while heading to class. Lots of things go on there. 
				Sometimes there are lines outside the building. Such a busy place. From there, turn left and go down that road, before turning right at another road.</p>
